Description: a Disease-Specific Network Enhancement Prioritization (DiSNEP) framework that enhances a comprehensive gene network for a disease using a gene-gene similarity network derived from a type of omics data of the disease that reflects correlations/interactions between genes for the disease, through a diffusion process. The enhanced disease-specific gene network better reflects true gene interactions for the disease and can be used to prioritize disease-associated genes.
