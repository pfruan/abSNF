\title{
Network enhancement by diffusion process.
}
\description{
Enhances a comprehensive gene network for a disease using a gene-gene similarity network derived from a type of omics data of the disease that reflects correlations/interactions between genes for the disease.
}
\usage{
diffus_matrix(s0, adjacency, alpha=0.75,iter=10, difference=1e-6)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{s0}{
The original general gene network.
}
  \item{adjacency}{
A gene-gene similarity network derived from a type of omics data of a disease.
}
  \item{alpha}{
A regularization parameter representing weights for signal sources where Î± = 0 means no disease-specific enhancement.
}
  \item{iter}{
Number of iterations.
}
  \item{difference}{
A parameter for converenge.
}
}
\value{
The enhanced disease-specific network.
